## Analysis

## Execution

1. The assumption is that you have a working Python 3.6 environment
1. Clone the [`git repository`](https://github.com/jayhjman/python-api-challenge) for this project
1. Change into the [`repository directory`](https://github.com/jayhjman/python-api-challenge) and then into [`WeatherPy`](WeatherPy/) or [`VacationPy`](VacationPy/)
